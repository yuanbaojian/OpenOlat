Matthai Kurian at the ETH Zürich

I worked at the ETH Zürich from 1.10.2000 till 30.10.2006. I was part of the
e-Learning Team at the International Relations and Security Network (ISN). I 
worked on Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) as a Systems Engineer. The SCORM 
(ADL) related software, which I developed during the time at the ISN, is 
published here under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

SCORM-1.2

   1. The PfPLMS SCORM-1.2 API Adapter Core
      (http://n.ethz.ch/student/matthaik/ApiAdapter/ApiAdapter)
      The ApiAdapter Core is used in the Free Software Systems ILIAS, ATutor and
      OLAT. ILIAS is the first Free Software System which was certified to the 
      highest level of SCORM-1.2 conformance (LMS-RTE3) by ADLNet.
   2. The PfPLMS SCORM-1.2 RTE
      (http://n.ethz.ch/student/matthaik/RTE/RTE)
      This is the RTE back end which I had developed for the PfP Web Classroom,
      which was supposed to be developed by one of our partners. It was designed
      to serve multiple instances of the classroom front end. 

Special permission is granted to use the PfPLMS SCORM-1.2 API Adapter Core, 
which is published under the GPL, under the terms of the LGPL in the OLAT System
, which is not Free Software.
