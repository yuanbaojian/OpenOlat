OLAT DATABASE
==================================

OLAT uses MySQL as its primary database for production.

For your installation take a binary distribution with MySQL that includes 
support for InnoDB. An example for InnoDB support is at the end
of this file.

Hibernate (http://www.hibernate.org/) is used as persistent layer
in the Java part of OLAT.

The database directory contains ready to use SQL scripts for MySQL and PostgreSQL
in the corresponding subdirectories.

See our docu for more information: http://www.openolat.org/documentation.html
