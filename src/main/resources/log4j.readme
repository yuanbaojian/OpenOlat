log4j.xml readme

log4j.xml in this directory is the default for lazy developers to have output on eclipse console.
Overwrite it with -Dlog4j.configuration="file:/tmp/mylog4j.xml" (java system property) and specify 
a path for your real logging configuration.

Note that when you create a "real" log4j.xml file you should specify the log dir path and the log 
file name also in your olat.local.properties:
log.dir
log.filename

Note that the LogFileParser which is used to lookup errors and attach them in error report emails
and to lookup errors in the admin panel must know those parameters above to work properly. This code
also assumes, that older logfiles are available using the filename + ".yyy-mm-dd" to look up log 
entries that occured in the past using the admin panel. Example: olat.log.2012-04-15
