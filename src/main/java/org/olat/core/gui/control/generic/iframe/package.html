<h3>IframeDisplayController</h3>
<p>OLAT always tried to show the learning content in a user friendly way, which means not with ugly scrollbars or pop up windows. 
This is not trivial as embedding content without frames means that we had to extract the body and apply all the css and js stuff from the head properly.
This is still implemented but shows sometimes problems with overwritten OLAT css classes and even worse with broken javascript stuff which leads in the worst case to 
an non working OLAT GUI. To prevent this we now use an Iframe solution which an feature to auto resize itself depending of the content height. Normally you will not see any scrollbars
from the iframe.</p>
<p>To achieve this we inject some javascript calls into the head of the loaded page which gets executed and try to resize the external iframe.
</p>
<h4>Normal Operation</h4>
<p>The user clicks an link in the menu tree which triggers the <code>setCurrentURI("new_uri.html")</code> method in the IFrameDisplayController and 
replaces the whole Iframe with a new start URL.

</p>
<h4>Inline Click</h4>
When the user clicks on a link inside the Iframe, the response comes back to the Iframe and the surrounding OLAT does not immediately know about the change. 
To update the menu tree accordingly we could wait until the next polling request repaints the dirty tree or we send an additional GET request to refresh the menu tree.
This is done by a javascript call which gets triggered as well from the Iframe content and simulates an normal business click which can update the menu tree. This workaround is
 needed as the file load mechanism which is done by a <code>Mapper</code> can not fire events. Mappers are implement at very low level in the framework for optimized performance.

</p>
<h4>Reload</h4>
<p>If reload is pressed the OLAT framework renders the last state again for all components and displays the "do not reload warning" message. To achieve this, it must detect if a page is loaded in our
iframe or if it was loaded into an iframe that is embedded in the user page. This is also done my javascript since it is not possible to detect the target window on the server side. 
<br />
Compare the image above and below to see the difference between a page loaded into our iframe and a page loaded into a frameset or a sub iframe page.
<br />
In a reload condition, our iframe will load the last page that has been loaded into this iframe. If the page contains iframes or framesets, it will not restore the last state of those frames. The same
is true when the user uses the main navigation e.g. to switch to the home and back to the iframe content.

</p>
<h4>Back Click</h4>
<p>Firefox and IE handle the back click different. Firefox does correctly a back on the main window and also on the iframe. The first request triggers the "do not reload" message and the second
which comes from the iframe itself load the new page. As this looks like an inline request the Controller triggers as well the "newUriEvent" which then updates the menu tree. IE does only trigger 
an back on the main window which leads to a waring message but no back on the iframe is triggered and the content stays the same.
</p>
<h4>Other special cases</h4>
<p>The menu tree update within an click inside an iframe does only work if your browser works in the Web 2.0 dom replacement mode. In the old legacy mode the events
get forwarded to the appropriate menu tree object but as the render cycle is already done the dirty menu tree does not get rerendered in this cycle (reload shows the correct menu tree)
. In OLAT 5.2.x the whole CP stuff was done without dom replacement and without an iframe, which was rather slow on older machines due to reloading the whole GUI for 
every request. As every image or additional css requested by the content was loaded with an unique business URL, there was also no caching of static resources in the 
browser. Mapper requests have the same path for the time the mapper lives. 
</p>
<h4>Other special cases: Click on root node of content package with cp tree expanded</h4>
<p>
This gets handled in non ajax mode like a reload, as the request does not find a new node to display and therefor the whole page gets reloaded with the same content.
