/**
 * Description:<br>
 * A controller implementing this interface is responsible for offering
 * navigation within the main content area (not within header/footer, these are
 * handled by olatbasecontroller). <br>
 * Following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>this controller will never be used as a childcontroller. (a childcontroller
 * is a controller that typically is used either within a part of the screen or
 * within a modal dialog: e.g. a usersearchcontroller)</li>
 * <li>this controller has to implement decent look and feel such as to provide
 * margins for left & right.</li>
 * <li>it is part of the application layout, together with olatbasecontroller.</li>
 * <li>typical implementations are: LayoutMain3ColsController (menu, content,
 * toolbar), and popuplayoutcontroller (providing only a close icon)</li>
 * </ul>
