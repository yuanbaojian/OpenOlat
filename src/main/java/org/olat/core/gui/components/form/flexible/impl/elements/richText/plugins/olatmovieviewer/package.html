<h3>OLAT movie viewer plugin for TinyMCE</h3>
<h4>Configuration</h4>
The HTMl editor has a custom TinyMCE plugin that is called <i>MovieViewer</i>. The idea is basically, to give users 
the possibility to embed a movie viewer that can handle streamed movies and play buttons based. 
<p>
The movies must be flash and not Quicktime. Why? Flash is preinstalled on pretty every computer whereas QuickTime is not.
<p>
The flash movies must be on a streaming server. 
<p>
To enable the movie viewer you must configure the HTML editor bean using the Spring configuration and make sure 
that the property <b>movieViewerEnabled</b> is set to <i>true</i>. Then there are some other variables to set. 
<p>
Please have a look at the default configuration file that can be found at 
<pre>
olatcore/src/main/resources/serviceconfig/org/olat/core/gui/components/form/flexible/impl/elements/richText/_spring/olatdefaultconfig.xml
</pre>
The current implementation of the viewer is done by <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/">Longtail Video</a>.

<h4>Usage</h4>
When configured, the editor has two new buttons:
<p>

<p>
The left button is use to insert a new movieViewer or to edit the selected movieViewer. Note that only one
movieViewer per page is supported.
<br>
The right button is used to create a play button for this movie. There can be as many or no play buttons on a
page as desired. Each play button can jump to a specified location in the movie.
<p>
In both the viewer and the play buttons the <i>start time</i> and the movie <i>duration</i> can be specified. 
The default value is 00:00:00.000 for both which means running from start to the end.
<p>

<p>
The start time must be entered using the format hh:mm:ss.000 where hh stands for hours, mm for
minutes, ss for seconds and 000 for milliseconds.
<br>
Example: A starttime of 00:25:10.000 would play the movie starting at the point 25 minutes and 10 seconds in the movie timeline.
