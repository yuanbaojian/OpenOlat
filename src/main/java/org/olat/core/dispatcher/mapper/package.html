<h2>Overview: mappers and static file handling</h2>
Brasato offers two ways to deliver files to the browser: 
<ol>
<li><a href="#dispatcher">Via dispatcher</a></li>
<li><a href="#mapper">Via mapper</a></li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="dispatcher">Dispatcher: static application files</h3>
<p>
To deliver static files that are part of the application brasato offers
one concept:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Files in webapp/static*</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first mechanism is used to embedd general framework resources, e.g.
css files, themes and basic javascript files. Those files are normally
embedded directly in body.html. Those files are deliverd using the
<code>StaticMediaDispatcher</code> class.
</p>

<h3><a name="mapper">Mapper: dynamic (content) files</h3>
<p>
While the delivery of static resources via the dispatchers described
above is a service infrastructure of the framework, the mapper comes in
place when you want to have control over the delivery process (e.g a
protected resource) or the delivered files are generated on the fly
(e.g. an excel file download).
</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Mappers must be registered using the mapper registry or the global
mapper registry. The difference between global and normal is that
globals mappers have a global mapper name based on the class that
registered for the mapper. Thus, the global mapper will always have the
same URL and can be cached by the browser.  Global mappers are shared between all users. Make sure you implement a
proper last-modified in the resources you deliver via global mappers!
</p>
<p>The normal mapper registry registers for user session based mappers.
The life-time of such mappers is bound to the user session.
</p>
<h4>Deregistration</h4>
<p>Make sure you unregister the mappers you register. Use the
BasicController to work with mappers and use the convenience methods
there to register mappers
</p>
<p>Note that global mappers don't need to be unregistered. They are
registered only once in a class and cleaned up when the applicatoin
shuts down.</p>
