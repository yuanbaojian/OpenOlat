<h3>Scheduling tasks</h3>

<p>Scheduling stuff is now done with Spring config. Search for olatextconfig.xml in package 
resources/serviceconfig/commons/scheduler</p>

<p>You can easily schedule repeating tasks with either a fixed time interval or 
use cron style syntax for scheduling interval</p>

<p>Make sure that you use the JobWithDb class if your job is accessing the database!</p>
