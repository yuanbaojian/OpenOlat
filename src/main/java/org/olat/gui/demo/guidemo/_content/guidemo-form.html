Forms are stateful, aut-rendering and fileds check on the
data entered depending on their type. Furthermore, forms provide
a hook to arbitrarialy validate fields. User feedback upon non-validating fields can
be set on any field individually. The framework comes with
predefined validators for some of the field types.
