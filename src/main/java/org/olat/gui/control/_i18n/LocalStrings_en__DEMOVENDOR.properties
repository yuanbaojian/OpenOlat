# Only those file and keys need to be in the vendor specific translation
# package that should override the general translation. If a key is not found
# in the vendor package, it will search in the normal language package. If still
# no key is found the key from the default language is used. Always make sure that 
# the default language you are using is complete (compare agains german which is
# the reference default language)!
# Best way to start:
# - Login as administrator
# - Choose from the top menu "Administrator"
# - Choose in the left Menu "Translation-Tool"
#
# Example of how to override the logout link and the meta tags presented to 
# google at the login page.
