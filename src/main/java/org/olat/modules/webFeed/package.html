<h1>Web Feed</h1>

<p>A web feed (or news feed) is a data format used for providing
users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a
web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe to it. Making a collection
of web feeds accessible in one spot is known as aggregation, which is
performed by an Internet aggregator. A web feed is also sometimes
referred to as a syndicated feed. (Source: Wikipedia)</p>

<p>The package provides managers, models, dispatchers and helpers
for dealing with web feeds (or just feeds). The feed items can be
created within OLAT or imported from an external feed (in this case,
OLAT serves as an aggregator instead of a content distributor). For
creating and reading feeds the ROME library is used
(https://rome.dev.java.net/).</p>
